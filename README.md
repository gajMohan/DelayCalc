# 🧼 Washing Machine Delay Start Calculator

Ever set a delay timer on your washing machine only to realize you did the math wrong and your laundry either sits there wet for hours or finishes at 2 AM? Well, worry no more—this **groundbreaking** web app does the thinking for you. 

## 🚀 Features
- Input how long your washing machine takes (*because apparently, that’s not common knowledge*).
- Enter when you *actually* want the cycle to finish.
- It does **the math** (yes, basic subtraction) and tells you when to set the delay.
- Mobile-friendly—because *obviously*.
- Works offline (just in case your internet is as reliable as your math skills).
- Installable as a PWA, so you can pretend it's a real app.
